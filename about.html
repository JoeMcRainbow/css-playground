            About the Site
          </h3>
          <p class="center maroon">
            This site was originally started as a freelance coding project hosted on GitHub in 2018.
            This project soon became my main working ground for testing new ideas.
            When this project was presented to one of my teachers, She asked "Is this for our team?" and I had originally said no.
            However in the weeks to come, I began a transformation of this project into a working website for use in an educational environment.

            This website is packed with useful links and resources for both students and teachers alike.
